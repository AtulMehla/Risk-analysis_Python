Project Description
Unlock the fundamentals of data analysis with this sample project on financial risk analytics. 
In this project, we will learn how to leverage Python Pandas to clean, explore, and visualize loan data. 
I have tried to guide step-by-step through data cleaning processes, uncovering insights, and generating key visualizations using Seaborn. 
By the end of the tutorial, we will have hands-on experience conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA), identifying trends and 
patterns in loan data to assess financial riskâ€”perfect for building your data analyst portfolio!
